##Project description

######BrainStorage is an HTML, JavaScript and CSS game that emphasizes the importance of investing quality time in pursuit of knowledge, avoiding everyday distractions. The game is interactive, accessible and challenging. Future improvements include leaderboard and more challenges. The aim is to encourage personal development and maximize the players' cognitive potential.

##MVP 

######The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the Super Brain game consists of an initial version with the basic features needed to provide a complete game experience. Key MVP features include:

Game Goal: The player must avoid collisions with obstacles and preserve the three available lives within a period of 10 seconds.

Victory Conditions: If the player manages to avoid collisions within the time limit, he wins the game and is encouraged to strengthen his brain by reading a book.

Defeat Conditions: If the player collides with obstacles three times during the 10 seconds, "game over" occurs and the virtual brain advises him to stop playing and go read a book.

Encouraging Message: The game highlights the importance of avoiding distractions and investing in activities that strengthen the mind, such as reading books.

The Super Brain Game MVP seeks to provide a basic but complete experience of the game's concept, encouraging the player to avoid distractions and strengthen their brain through reading. From that starting point, the game can be improved and expanded with additional features such as increasing difficulty levels, improved graphics and extra challenges for a more immersive experience.


######List of features to  implement after the MVP - In the Super Brain game, it is planned to add new stages and obstacles to encourage players' brain development. Progressive levels will gradually increase in difficulty, testing your mental agility. The new obstacles will introduce different challenges and encourage more complex dodging strategies. These additions will make the game a challenging and stimulating environment, promoting personal growth and reaching the player's maximum potential.
